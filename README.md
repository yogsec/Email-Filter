# Email-Filter
Email Filter is a command-line tool designed to clean and filter email lists by removing unwanted or invalid emails, removing duplicates, and keeping only the most useful email for each domain (such as contact@ or info@). It also handles noisy lines and extracts only valid emails from messy inputs.
